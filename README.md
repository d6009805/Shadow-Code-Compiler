# Shadow-Code-Compiler
The Shadow Code language is used to compile to Scratch Assembly Language (SASM) in this Scratch Project:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1219146913/

Documentation for ShadowCodeCompiler has not come yet.

# Compiling Scripts
In order to compile a program, run "(path)/Shadow Code Compiler/ShadowCodeCompiler/scc <filename>".

Compilation results are available in "(path)/Shadow Code Compiler/out/<filename>.sasm" and are also displayed in the terminal.

Optionally, add scc.bat to your PATH in environmental variables to be able to use "scc <filename>"
